### Player Profile
- Displays the userâ€™s information such as Username, Tier, and total games played.
- Profile information is stored in Firestore and is unique to each user.

### Player Profile Customization
- Users can change their profile avatar, username, and view their gaming badges.
- Avatar customization is tied to user tiers, and points determine which avatars are available for selection.

### LeaderBoard:
- Global Leaderboard: Displays the overall rankings of all users based on the points they earn from playing games.
- Points are calculated and stored in Firebase Firestore and updated in real time using the app's API.
- Users can view their current ranking, and the global leaderboard is continuously updated to reflect user performance across games.

### Personalised LeaderBoard
- Users can create a private leaderboard to compete with selected friends or players.
- Users can search for others by username via Firebase Firestore and add them to their private leaderboard.
- Each private leaderboard is isolated from the global rankings and can be customized to include specific players.

### API:
- RESTful API hosted on Google Cloud, responsible for managing leaderboard data, points calculation, and user management.
- The API communicates with Firebase Firestore to fetch, update, and store user points, which determine a user's position on the leaderboard.
Endpoints include:

    GET /leaderboard/global: Fetches the global leaderboard.
    GET /leaderboard/private/{id}: Fetches a private leaderboard by its ID.
    POST /leaderboard/private: Creates a new private leaderboard.
    PUT /user/points: Updates a user's points after a game session.
    GET /user/search: Searches for users by username on Firebase. 

### Firebase Cloud Messaging:
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is used for sending notifications to users.
Notifications are triggered for various events, such as:

    Updates in the user's position on the leaderboard.
    Game invitations or challenges from other users.
    Changes in a private leaderboard's composition.

- FCM ensures users are engaged and informed of important updates within the app.


### Support AI
- The app integrates AI-powered support through Gemini, which powers a support chatbot.
- The chatbot assists users by troubleshooting common issues, answering general questions, and providing guidance on how to use the app's features.
- The AI chatbot is available 24/7, enhancing the user experience by offering instant help and support.

### Community and Feedback
- The app includes a Community and Feedback page where users can:

    Converse with other players, share tips, strategies, and opinions about the games.
    Submit feedback to the development team, which is stored in Firebase Firestore.
    The feedback mechanism allows us to receive direct user input on improving the app, which helps guide future updates and feature improvements.

### Privacy Policy
- The app includes a Privacy Policy to ensure transparency regarding how user data is collected, stored, and used.
- The privacy policy outlines the use of Firebase services, the collection of data (such as usernames, points, and leaderboard entries), and how this information is protected.

## Games

### TicTacToe
- Description: TicTacToe is a classic two-player game where the objective is to get three of your marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) on a 3x3 grid while preventing your opponent from doing the same.
- Features:
  - Player vs Player mode
  - Simple and intuitive UI
  - Instant win or draw detection
  - Reset and play again functionality
- How to Play:
  1. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) in empty squares.
  2. The first player to align three marks in a row wins.
  3. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

### Floppy Bird
- A fun and simple game inspired by the classic Flappy Bird.
- Players must navigate a bird through a series of obstacles, earning points based on how far they progress.
- As part of the game, players earn points that are updated to the global leaderboard after each session.

### Colour Matcher
- A quick-thinking game where the player must determine whether the font color matches the word's spelling.
- Players are shown words with different font colors and must answer True or False depending on whether the displayed font color matches the color the word spells out.
- Points are awarded based on accuracy and speed, and these points contribute to both the global and private leaderboards.

## Prerequisites For Developer Usage

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following requirements:

- **Android Studio**: Make sure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed. You can download it from the [official website](https://developer.android.com/studio). Android Studio is required to build and run the application on your local environment.
  
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have JDK 17 installed, as it's the version used in this project. You can download it from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) or [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html).

- **Firebase Account**: You need to set up a Firebase project to enable Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and Google Sign-In. You can create a Firebase project at the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

- **Google Services Configuration**: Add the `google-services.json` file to your Android project, which you can download from your Firebase console once you've set up Firebase Authentication and Firestore DB.

- **CircleCI Account**: Set up a CircleCI account and connect it to your GitHub repository for continuous integration. Visit the [CircleCI website](https://circleci.com) for more details.

- **SonarQube Setup**: Install and configure SonarQube for code quality checks. You can either use the [SonarQube cloud service](https://sonarcloud.io) or set it up locally.

- **Git**: Ensure that you have Git installed to clone the repository and manage version control. Download it from [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/).

- **Gradle**: Make sure Gradle is installed and configured on your system. You can follow the instructions on the [official Gradle website](https://gradle.org/install/).

Once these prerequisites are set up, you should be ready to clone the project and start working with the code.


   
## Usage




## Testing

We have implemented automated testing in the CI/CD pipeline for this project using GitHub Actions. This testing process ensures code quality and functionality before any code is merged into the master branch. Here's how the testing is set up:

****1. Unit Tests with Gradle****

As part of the build process, the project includes unit tests that are executed using Gradle. Each push to the master branch triggers the CI pipeline, where these tests are run automatically.

- **Gradle Test Command**: 

- **Test Results**: If any tests fail, the pipeline is stopped, and the issues are reported in the GitHub Actions log, preventing the code from being merged.

****2. Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline****

The pipeline is configured in `.github/workflows/build.yml` and includes the following key steps:

- **Set up JDK 17**: Ensures that the correct Java version is used.
  
- **Run Unit Tests**: Executes the tests via the `./gradlew test` command.
  
- **Build Project**: Builds the project using `./gradlew build` after successful testing.


****3. Test Workflow and Github Actions****
```yaml

The YML can be found under actions in the repository
BrainRotGame_OPSC7312POE\.github\workflows\generate-apk-aab-debug-release.yml

```

### Code Quality and Coverage

The project is integrated with SonarQube to measure code quality, coverage, and potential duplications. This integration helps ensure that the code adheres to best practices and maintains high-quality standards.

- **SonarQube Report**: After each build, a SonarQube analysis is triggered to ensure that the code meets our quality gate. This process involves evaluating various metrics such as code coverage, the presence of bugs, and potential security vulnerabilities. If any of these metrics fall below acceptable thresholds, the quality gate will prevent the code from progressing through the CI/CD pipeline.

### Artifacts

After passing all tests, the APKs and AAB (App Bundle) files are generated and uploaded as artifacts for further manual testing. You can find the generated APKs and AAB files in the GitHub Actions artifacts section after the build is complete. This allows for easy access to build outputs for deployment or additional testing processes.

In summary, integrating SonarQube into our workflow not only enhances code quality but also ensures that we maintain high standards throughout our development process. The use of artifacts facilitates efficient testing and deployment practices within our CI/CD pipeline.
